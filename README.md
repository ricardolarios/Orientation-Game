# Orientation-Game
This is a small game that I made using Advanced Student Language for an interview to become
an Orientation Leader. The goal is to move the ball at the bottom of the screen (the player)
in order to catch balls that fall from the top of the screen and gain points, and to avoid the
spikes. At the end, depending on the score, it reveals pictures and facts about those pictures 
that relate to me! (Very great reward, I know)
